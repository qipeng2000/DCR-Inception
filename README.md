# DCR-Inception
DCR-Inception network for driver expression recognition. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the DCR-Inception outperforms most competitive methods, achieving average accuracy, f1-score, and cost-sensitive error score of 82.81%, 0.890, and 0.242 on the RAF-DB dataset, respectively.
